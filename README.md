# Task Manager (Python + SQLite)

A simple database-driven application built with Python and SQLite.  
This project demonstrates CRUD operations, SQL integration, and backend logic.

## 🚀 Features
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Update task status (pending/completed)
- Delete tasks
- SQLite database auto-created on first run

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- SQLite (built-in)

## ▶️ Running the App

### 1. Run the script

### 2. Use the interactive menu to:
- Add tasks  
- View tasks  
- Update task status  
- Delete tasks  
- Exit the program  

## 🧠 How It Works
- The app connects to an SQLite database named `tasks.db`
- A `tasks` table is created automatically if it doesn't exist
- All operations (add, view, update, delete) interact directly with the database
- The menu runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit
